        "\n",
        "Here are some key advantages:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Memory Efficiency: Generators produce items one at a time and only keep track of their current state. This is in contrast to regular functions that return a list or other data structure containing all the values, which can consume a lot of memory for large datasets.\n",
        "* Lazy Evaluation: Values are generated on demand as they are needed, rather than all at once. This is particularly useful for large or infinite sequences where generating all values upfront would be impossible or impractical.\n",
        "* Simpler Code for Iterators: Generators provide a more concise and readable way to create iterators compared to writing a custom class with __iter__ and __next__ methods.\n",
        "* Working with Infinite Sequences: Since generators yield values one at a time, they can be used to represent infinite sequences without running out of memory.\n",
